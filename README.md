# hel-kitesurfing-good-forecast-trip-alert
As a kitesurfer living in Warsaw (Poland), I wanted to build an alert for good weather conditions in Hel Peninsula.  This program get alerted via email for good weather forecast conditions to pack your equipment and drive 5h for at least 2 days of flying on the Puck Bay.
